finished all of introduction portion of rustlings
did variables1 and variables2 excercises of chapter 1 Variables and had to stop at variables3 because despite the name correlating with 3.1 portion of the Rust programming book in reality, variables3 goes in hand with 3.2. Will probably just read all of Chapter 3 before finishing ch 1 of rustlings
